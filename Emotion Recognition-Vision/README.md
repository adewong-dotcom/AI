This program evaluates a person's emotion based on microexpressions. 

I will test it with 3 different datasets that will increase in complexity as the ML model because more precise:

# 1. Fer2013 - this dataset has grayscale images classified into seven basic emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, or neutral. It comprises a total of 35000+ images which makes it substantial.
#    it will be used to create my first model given its simple dataset.

# 2. AffectNet - this dataset has colored images classified into anger, disgust, fear, pleasure, sorrow, surprise, and neutral. It comprises over a million images of people a wide range of demographics, including 
#    ages, genders, and races to prevent any bias.

# 3. Google Facial Expression Comparison Dataset - this dataset has images taken from Flickr classified into Amusement, Anger, Awe, Boredom, Concentration, Confusion, Contemplation, Contempt, Contentment, Desire, 
#    Disappointment, Disgust, Distress, Doubt, Ecstasy, Elation, Embarrassment, Fear, Interest, Love, Neutral, Pain, Pride, Realization, Relief, Sadness, Shame, Surprise, Sympathy, Triumph. Its real-world images
#    will be used to test the efficiency of the model and fine tune the results.
